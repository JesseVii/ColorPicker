# How to use
When clicking outside of the panel it will stop updating it until you click somewhere in the panel again. Then you can just move your mouse and see the color and position in the panel.

# Setting up
You can easily import this in your IDE and then run the Main class. You can also export it to a runnable jar file through your IDE.
